# Lime
 A bot that is basically a bunch of commands I make that are intended for public usage. Written in Python and used with VoxelBotUtils

# Commands
Commands range from a lot of things, its basically whatever I decide to do, for detail you can do l.help, and it'll send you a dm.

# Contributing
Any sort of contribution is very appreciative from me, it means a lot to me, even if its a small contribution.
Issues with the bot can go into the issues page. Resolving issues and/or suggesting code changes can go into pull requests. Please leave your suggestion with the exact code.
